#Q1
#I would want to keep 3 factors (Rc2,1,3) 
#because they have a total cumulative proportion of .82 and explain a lot of the proporation if looking at 4 factors
#also when looking at some of the visualizations the drop off after 3 factors is immense and a fourth factor would only include 1 column

#Q2
#Model explanation
#The model is showing us what columns have the most significance i each factor, 
#it shows us the total variance it brings and how much weight that is globally, 
#it also does underlying linear algebra to explain if the factor count is too high, too low, or sufficient
#And based on the RMSE the error is incredibly low

#Q3- what columns are attributed to which factor

#In RC1 we have BMI, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness
