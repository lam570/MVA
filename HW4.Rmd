library(readr)
diabetes <- read_csv("C:/Users/Student/Downloads/diabetes.csv")
colnames(diabetes)[7] = "pedigree"
str(diabetes)
attach(diabetes)

#correlation matrix
cor(diabetes[-9])

#pca analysis
diabetes_pca <- prcomp(diabetes[,-9],scale=TRUE)
diabetes_pca
summary(diabetes_pca)
eigen_diabetes<- diabetes_pca$sdev^2

#explanation
#by using the summary function I'm able to see how much variance each PC dimension adds, in terms of variate representation PC1/2 add around 20-25 percent of the total variance and everything past that adds less then 15 percent util pc8 which only adds 5 percent of the total variance, also to note when using the cor function to find the correlation matrix PC2 by far has the highest correlation with most variables.


#visualizations

#Scree Diagram
plot(eigen_diabetes, xlab = "Component number", ylab = "Component variance", type = "l", main = "Scree diagram")
#but if we use only pc1-3 we amount to only 61 percent of the variance, going to look at second elbow

#log diagram
plot(log(eigen_diabetes), xlab = "Component number",ylab = "log(Component variance)", type="l",main = "Log(eigenvalue) diagram")
#the second elbow seems to be key here so I'll use PC6 which cumultaively includes around 90 percent of the total variance


###final conclusion
#I will use PC1-6 to get 90% of the total variance from my data and thus discard two dimensions making it easier to further analysis
