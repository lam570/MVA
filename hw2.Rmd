#question: what is the skew of blood pressure for diabetes patients?

#question: what is the average visually amount of insulin for a patient?
#insight:

#biavariate
boxplot(diabetes[,1:8])
#question: what column(s) have the most noise and outliers on a quick glance
#insight: insulin, glucose, blood pressure have the most noise while pedigree is incredibly consistent, probably need to scale everything because insulin is much wider in range then anything else

pairs(diabetes[,1:8])
#question: what are the general relationships between the columns
#insight: seems like most of the data has a wide ranging postive relationship with other info

#does the age of a patient and their glucose level correlate to a smaller amount of pregnancies over time?

#yes it does but glucose can be high no matter the age
