#here the model as closer discrimints meaning the groups are closer together and maybe the model isnt a great fit for this data

# Residual Analysis 
residuals(wdbc_raw.lda)
#lda never has residuals due to the underlying nature of the model

# Prediction 
wdbc_raw.lda.predict <- predict(wdbc_raw.lda, newdata = test_raw.df)
wdbc_raw.lda.predict
#here the difference between both classes is quite high meaning the model is operating well but logistic regression could still be a better fit

# Model Accuracy
