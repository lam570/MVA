##p value is less then 0.00000000000000022 meaning there is a strong correlation between these variables, we should drill down on them

#variance: F-Test
#we are doing the F test to see if there is a lot of noise in our variance, and to judge group means with the variance between them, essentially making sure all of our data has similar means because if they don't we need to drill down on those variables making the most noise
attach(diabetes)
var.test(BMI[Outcome=="0"],BMI[Outcome=="1"])
#here the p values is 0.295 higher then our significant value meaning there is not a significant relationship in the group means between BMI and Outcome

detach(diabetes)
 
####multivariate
discale <- scale(diabetes[,1:8])

##Mean Test- hotelling test
#the purpose of the hoteling test is to find out if my variables are close together in regards to their averages or are they different and thus harder to group together

hotdia <- hotelling.test(Pregnancies+Glucose+BloodPressure+SkinThickness+Insulin+BMI+pedigree+Age ~ Outcome,data=diframe)

#here the the t stat value is 333.3949 meaning there is a large amount of difference between our variables, meaning our variables are not very similar and we can look at our univariate data to drill down on specific variables

#Variance Test- Manova
#we do the Multiple Anova test to test out multiple group means and their variance
summary(manova(as.matrix(diabetes[,-9])~Outcome, data=diabetes))
#here again the p value is less then 0.00000000000000022 meaning there is a huge relationship between our independent and dependent variables
